# What is Joomla! ChurchCal?

ChurchCal for [Joomla 3 or 4](https://www.joomla.org){:target="_blank"} is a Joomla! module that retrieves calendar entries from [ChurchTools](https://www.church.tools/en/home){:target="_blank"} calendars, using the [ChurchTools API](https://api.church.tools){:target="_blank"}, and displays them in a Joomla! module as a list of sorted calendar entries.

Joomla! Churchcal is not using any `iframe` and it does not display a classical calendar view, nor does it provide any functionality to edit the ChurchCal calendar. It simply displays a list of calendar entries.
